# Fraud_Detection_in_Online_Transactions
# Objective
The main aim of this analysis is to create a reliable classification model that can accurately determine if an online transaction is fraudulent. By utilizing the features in the dataset, the objective is to train a machine learning model that can effectively differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

# Approach:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA serves as a foundational step in data analysis, employing statistical and graphical techniques to delve into the dataset's attributes, uncovering its inherent characteristics, structure, and potential outliers.
Early implementation of EDA in data science or machine learning projects is crucial, facilitating the acquisition of valuable insights and providing direction for subsequent analysis steps.
* Data Preprocessing:

Address missing or anomalous values in the dataset.
Encode categorical variables if necessary.
Scale numerical features to ensure they have a uniform impact on the model.
* Handling Imbalance:

Apply techniques to address class imbalance, such as oversampling the minority class (fraudulent transactions) using methods like SMOTE or undersampling the majority class.
* Model Selection:

Experiment with various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
Use appropriate evaluation metrics for imbalanced datasets, focusing on metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
* Hyperparameter Tuning:

Perform a systematic search for optimal hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to enhance model performance.
* Model Evaluation:

Assess the performance of the trained model on a separate test dataset. Evaluate the model's ability to accurately classify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
*Deployment:

Deployed the model using Streamlit for an interactive web application.
Enabled real-time fraud detection through a user-friendly interface.
